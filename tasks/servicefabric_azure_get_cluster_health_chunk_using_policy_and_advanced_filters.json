The health evaluation is done based on the input cluster health chunk query description.The query description allows users to specify health policies for evaluating the cluster and its children.Users can specify very flexible filters to select which cluster entities to return. The selection can be done based on the entities health state and based on the hierarchy.The query can return multi-level children of the entities based on the specified filters. For example, it can return one application with a specified name, and for this application, returnonly services that are in Error or Warning, and all partitions and replicas for one of these services.",

This parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'.Service Fabric REST API version is based on the runtime version in which the API was introduced or was changed. Service Fabric runtime supports more than one version of the API. This is the latest supported version of the API. If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.",
