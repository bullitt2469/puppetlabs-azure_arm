	"description": "Returns the information about the application types that are provisioned or in the process of being provisioned in the Service Fabric cluster. Each version of an application type is returned as one application type. The response includes the name, version, status, and other details about the application type. This is a paged query, meaning that if not all of the application types fit in a page, one page of results is returned as well as a continuation token, which can be used to get the next page. For example, if there are 10 application types but a page only fits the first three application types, or if max results is set to 3, then three is returned. To access the rest of the results, retrieve subsequent pages by using the returned continuation token in the next query. An empty continuation token is returned if there are no subsequent pages.",

If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.",
