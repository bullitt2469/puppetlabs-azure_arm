If a lower API version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification.Additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. So if the latest API version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that API. However the behavior of the API will be as per the documented 6.0 version.",

Therefore, it will be batched according to the HealthReportSendInterval configuration.This is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing.By default, reports are not sent immediately.",
